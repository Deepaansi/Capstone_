Some mishaps are unnoticeable or are a nuisance, others get serious and unavoidable. One trips and falls while looking at a poster, other clashes into a pole, still other smashes the tomatoes eyeing and slips like a skater. Such accidents are alright as they harm slightly and happen almost every day."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Street accidents are part of the major public health problems in the world, affecting both economically developed and developing country. The association with high rates of mortality and morbidity is strong and it translates into a huge economic burden for society. If we have a look at middle- and high-income countries, the striking difference is that, although the number of vehicles involved in accidents is globally the same, low-income countries represent $80\\%$ of the total deaths, while the latter only the $7\\%$. Of course, strict regulation of driving rules and the process of accurate street maintenance aimed to mitigate the number and the gravity of accidents didn't start immediately, but as the number of vehicles per person increased and the society became very interconnected. Not only middle-income countries have more limited resources to put into safer infrastructures, but their society is continuously changing at a a speed that most of high-income countries reached only in the past."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Our country is over populated. Roads are also busy. So, street accidents have become quite common. Most often accidents take place for careless driving. Everyday we find the news of many road accidents in newspaper. Last week I saw a serious street accident. It took place before my eyes. A young boy was crossing the Mirpur Road. Just at that time a truck was coming at a great speed. A boy was run over by the speedy truck. The truck did not stop rather it speeded away. I rushed to the spot. To my horror I saw that, he was no more a human body but a lump of flesh. I was greatly shocked at this tragic scene. I could not forget the scene. We should bear up in mind that life is more valuable than time."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
