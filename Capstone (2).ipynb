And a large part of losses is caused by a small number of serious accidents. Reducing traffic accidents, especially serious accidents, is nevertheless always an important challenge. The proactive approach, one of the two main approaches for dealing with traffic safety problems, focuses on preventing potential unsafe road conditions from occurring in the first place. For the effective implementation of this approach, accident prediction and severity prediciton are critical. If we can identify the patterns of how these serious accidents happen and the key factors, we might be able to implement well-informed actions and better allocate financial and human resources."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### DATA SET OVERVIEW"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "US-Accident dataset is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the United States.
